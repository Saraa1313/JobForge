We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome. We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team. Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git. We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual. We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents. --

hn_46110614,Software Engineer,"Goblins | https://goblinsapp.com | Founding Engineer #3 | Williamsburg, New York | ONSITE | $100-200k (+ generous equity) At Goblins, we're building America's favorite teacher, starting with K-12 math. We're live in thousands of classrooms for in-class assignments, extra practice, and homework. Students work on a whiteboard while our models analyze their work in real time and nudge them with questions that make them think. Teachers get instant visibility into how the class is doing, who needs help, and what to assign next. We just raised our seed round and are backed by the Gates Foundation, giving us the ability to build something transformative in education. Here's what you might work on: - Create shareable ""aha moment"" videos from real student sessions. Turn anonymized whiteboard work and Goblin–student dialogues into short videos or interactive replays that highlight the value of Goblins. Automatically identify the best moments, strip out sensitive data, and produce artifacts that teachers, parents, and districts want to watch and share. - Rewrite our diffusion transformer real-time avatar stack. Our Goblin avatars are already in production. Improve audio–motion sync, temporal coherence, and expressiveness, while cutting latency and cost so they run smoothly at 100k+ student scale. - Extend continuous diagnostics to high-stakes like the SAT and ACT. We track mastery against state standards with our spin on IRT. Extend this to SAT/ACT-style exams: infer score distributions from behavior, validate on real data, and compute minimal targeted practice that reliably moves predicted scores. - Design uncheatable problem formats. Generative AI can solve most traditional math problems and show fake work. Build formats where copying is harder than thinking: dynamic graphs, constructive proofs, counterexample generation, debugging flawed solutions, multi-step conceptual checks. Make them auto-gradable, resistant to copy-paste, and stable at scale. - Build real-time instructional agents. Detect underlying student misconceptions from their work and have an agent ""drop in"" only when needed. It should generate short, visual, 3blue1brown-style explanations tailored to the specific misunderstanding, and create diagrams, animations, and interactive examples that adapt as the student responds. The role is based in our Williamsburg, Brooklyn office in NYC (on-site only). You'll join our tight-knit founding engineering team of 3—myself (the CTO) and two founding engineers with collective experience from Stanford, Stripe, Amazon, and X1. As our third founding engineer, you'll have full ownership of critical projects and ship production systems that impact thousands of students and teachers in real classrooms within your first few weeks.

  Email: greg.james.kaye@gmail.com Hi! Greg Kaye here, I'm an experienced Full Stack Engineer with about 10 years of experience working on backend, frontend, and data science applications. I have spent the last few years developing software for quantitative trading (self-employed). I'm seeking a change, an opportunity to work on a team and create real value for customers again. I have a track record of delivering results quickly and taking ownership of the projects I’m tasked with. Also worth mentioning, I welcome the opportunity to work with tech outside of my resume. I work well in unfamiliar territory so typically have no problem hitting the ground running. I recently built and launched Onelife Creations ( https://onelifecreations.com ), a platform that turns a user-provided photo into personalized merch that is automatically generated, printed, and delivered to the customer. Behind the scenes it handles image processing and template rendering, produces product mockups, and takes payments through Stripe. It’s a concrete example of me building and deploying a complete product end-to-end. If you think I might be a good fit for your team/project please don't hesitate to reach out.

I am currently specializing down the road of creating digital characters and universes through diffusion models (both video as well as images). On my blog ( https://edwin.genego.io ) you will find extensive case study material on the topic, as well as a showcase of my own creative skills. Keep in mind that I come to this through the lense of applied-GenAI and not a pure AI/ML background; although I have worked with AI/ML teams well before 2022. I am currently looking for a startup, company, agency or anyone really that is doing world, universe or character building with AI. Whether this is through GenAI models by building IP or something else. my current work spreads 50+ custom management commands for AI image generation, character IP systems, scene replication with layered prompt architecture; which is more or less openly documented on my website. What I am also looking for is fractional or project work (2-6 week cycles) involving generative AI, creative tooling, or content pipelines. https://edwin.genego.io/blog",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46128938,hacker_news

  Email: agile.desk3846@fastmail.com (masked address so I can filter out spam) I'm a seasoned data + AI leader with 10+ years experience building high-performance teams focused on automation, analytics, and data-driven results. I'm the type of person who looks at complex data challenges and sees opportunities for radical transformation. Whether it's automating workflows, experimenting with AI, or creating novel ML models that drive efficiency, I'm all about pushing boundaries and turning data into a growth accelerator. I was previously the first analytics hire at a Computer Vision startup, Roboflow. Before that, I was co-founder of a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Data at PMG Digital Agency where I built the team from the ground up. It's most important for me to work for a mission-driven company that wants to scale with bold and innovative approaches. I want to sink my teeth into tough problems and learn new things. I'm primarily looking for data leadership or technical product roles. I enjoy ideating solutions, building MVPs, experimentation, and orchestrating all of the work to achieve a strategic vision. I prefer a 70/30 split between leader/IC. I prefer smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up.

    Email: (my username) at protonmail dot com My preferred coding style is high-rigour and highly-documented, which tends to be a great fit for contract work. I have a track record of delivering quality results under minimal supervision. My specialist skills: - The Rust language, which has been my daily driver for more than a decade. - Multimedia (2D rendering, vector graphics, video, audio, libav, Web Codecs...) - Performance optimisation (parallel programming, SIMD, GPU acceleration, soft-realtime programming...) Fields in which I'm highly experienced, but below specialist level: - Web development, with a frontend bias (TypeScript, React, JS build systems, the Web platform, WebGL, WebGPU, Node, WebAssembly...) - Native development (native build systems, FFIs, low-level Win32, basic fluency in C/C++...) - Leadership, communication and technical writing, all learned in a previous career. I should also mention a modest level of experience in computer vision, greenfield R&D, game engine development, programming language development, and data compression. I'm comfortable with ubiquitous tools like Bash, Make, Git, GitHub, Docker and Figma. (Sorry for the keyword spam; you know how it is.) I'm currently offering a 50% discount for any contract which seems highly educational. My areas of interest include acoustics, DSP, embedded programming, Svelte, Solid, functional languages, Swift, and backend development in general. I can be flexible on time zones.

In a way, I am a ""full stack"" developer, but my stack may involve a front end to a piece of hardware rather than the cloud. I first got into programming via ham radio, so RF hardware remains an interest. • Designing and building APIs. Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build. • Talk with users!

  Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elninja

  Email: josue [at] elninja.com I'm a backend/platform engineer and developer advocate with over 10 years of experience building systems at scale across startups and growth-stage companies like Uber and DoorDash. Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support. At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling. I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016. After wrapping up at Uber, I took the summer off for personal restoration following a divorce. I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense. Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia.

Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, WebGL, WASM, JS, TS Interests : systems programming, 2D & 3D graphics, performance -------- Hello, my name is Jesse. I describe myself as a competent generalist, and a lifelong learner. I'm frequently working on something I've never done before.  I've worked at every level of the stack, from cycle-shaving hot loops that saturate instruction pipelines to the frontend of large web applications.  My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup; I wrote prototypes for an ISA, compiler, a cycle simulator and visual debugger. In terms of hard technical skills, I can quickly become productive in nearly any language, and at any level of the stack. I'm comfortable working in heavily multithreaded/async soft-realtime environments where performance is a key acceptance criteria. I have a good understanding of modern hardware architectures, including GPUs, from main memory to registers and instruction pipelines. I have working knowledge of interpreters, dynamic language runtimes and garbage collectors. I'm convinced I can learn nearly anything (albeit some things more quickly than others), given an appropriate problem domain to apply it to. In terms of business value, I can take hand-wavy visions of new products and turn them into working prototype(s), quickly. I'm comfortable refining those raw materials and delivering real value to customers, internal or external. I have a track record of successfully identifying 80/20 solutions and love the feeling of making tools that make peoples lives better. In my personal life, I enjoy travelling, surfing, climbing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, pirates, and attending raves. I like the phrase ""have strong opinions, weakly held"". If I was born to do one thing in this world, it's program computers.

hn_45804393,Hardware / Embedded,"Absinthe Labs | Full-Stack Engineer | REMOTE / NYC Hybrid | Full-Time About us: Absinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast. The problem we’re solving: Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere.

This is for retired executives and well-connected professionals. You make high-level introductions to your network (City Managers, Police/Fire Chiefs, Plant Managers, HR VPs). When we close a deal for in-person or online training, you earn a generous referral commission. You leverage your credibility; we do the rest. Who We Are Looking For:

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger ( https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package ...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things. I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.) I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys). I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects.

I'm a software developer experienced in designing and building distributed systems. I've been working on a MMORPG that uses Elixir for the backend. This project has been done mostly out of self-interest and curiosity. Currently the game has some players and fans, with servers located across multiple regions. Prior to this I was a backend developer at a financial services start-up that specialized in implementing payment solutions for non-profit companies. In this role I wore many different hats. I did Data Engineering work in the form of designing schemas and building PCI-compliant data pipelines for use in analytics (DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, AWS Athena). I also built out several integrations to different CRM + ERP platforms. Furthermore I was responsible for the company DevOps strategy and architected a multi-AWS account set-up + CI/CD pipeline for all company infrastructure deployments. I'm open to any intermediate backend or fullstack developer roles. I have some interest in working within the games industry, so if you have any roles there, I would also be interested.

I'm Dylan Fitzgerald, a software engineer with a knack for bridging the gap between technology and team dynamics. With a technical background in Ruby on Rails, Elixir, and DevOps, I excel in elevating the quality of projects while fostering a harmonious team environment. My years of consulting across the industry give me perspective on what works—and doesn't—with teams and process. In particular, I thrive on turning the implicit into deliberate decisions. I've mostly consulted over the last seven years or so, but am open to going in-house for the right fit.

My training in Shape Up and cross-industry exposure helps me tailor strategies specific to your team’s dynamics. I thrive in collaborative settings, helping leadership and teams navigate through their challenges to achieve exemplary results.

  Email: hnjobs@any.unlocked-doors.com Hi, I'm Vincent, an engineer with 10+ years of experience working in all parts of the engineering stack. Most recently I've worked on the front end side of things and am specialized in using React professionally, but I'm quick to pick up new technologies as necessary. (personally I prefer Svelte when working on my own projects) Go and Typescript are my two favorite languages. I've consistently been told by my managers that I work fast or was one of the best engineers they had on their team. Personally I'm looking for a job that I feel like actually has some kind of positive benefit on the world, or something that seems particularly challenging or interesting. This can range anywhere from a note-taking application to managing retirement funds to writing a Typescript to Go compiler to writing a new database. I'm not interested in one of the 5 million AI hype cycle jobs (partly because I dislike LLMs), and I actively hate the blockchain, ads, and tracking users. I do not, and will never, compromise on privacy issues. A list of things you should know about me and how I'm going to do my best work for you: * I want to be able to work on something a bit more interesting than another simple REST application. * I want my hours to be flexible, meaning when I start/end or being able to take some time in the middle of the day for groceries or a doctors appointment. * I want to be able to come up with ideas I think would be useful/interesting and be given some time to work on them. I know that there are things I'm going to have to do for the business that aren't going to be these things, but I need some amount of time to do this or I'm going to struggle as a worker. * I'm going to have strong opinions about all sorts of things, and I expect to be able to have a conversation about them and not just be dismissed. * I'm going to want to improve things, and if I continuously get told ""no"", it's going to kill my morale. I've previously lived in Japan a couple decades ago and studied the language intensively for 2 years at that time in one of the schools dedicated to helping foreigners go to university or get jobs there. (specifically at: 東京平田日本語学院. I almost passed JLPT N2 then, but I'm nowhere close to that level currently) I've recently been picking back up on studying Japanese again to maybe fulfill a long-held dream of going back to Japan longer than a vacation. So on the off chance you're someone in Japan hiring for a position you think I'd be a fit for (and you're not a black company), please reach out. NOTE: I am going on an extended trip to Japan in November and December 2025, so while I'm open to doing interviews (time zones notwithstanding), I will not be able to start working until 2026",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45803178,hacker_news
hn_45801043,Hardware / Embedded,"Location: Remote, Canada Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, WebGL, WASM, JS, TS Interests : systems programming, 2D & 3D graphics, performance -------- Hello, my name is Jesse. I describe myself as a competent generalist, and a lifelong learner. I'm frequently working on something I've never done before. My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup; I wrote prototypes for an ISA, compiler and a (really sweet) cycle simulator & debugger. In terms of hard technical skills, I can quickly become productive in nearly any language, and at any level of the stack. I'm comfortable working in soft-realtime environments which are heavily multithreaded/async, and performance is a key acceptance criteria. I have a good understanding of modern hardware architectures, including GPUs, from main memory to registers and instruction pipelines. I have working knowledge of interpreters and dynamic language runtimes, including GCs. I'm convinced I can learn nearly anything (albeit some things more quickly than others), given an appropriate problem domain to apply it to. In terms of business value, I can take hand-wavy visions of new products and turn them into working prototype(s), quickly. I'm comfortable refining those raw materials and delivering real value to customers, internal or external. I have a long track record of successfully identifying 80/20 solutions and love the feeling of making tools that make peoples lives better. I'm a natural leader; informal teams coalesce around me when I'm not in a labelled position of leadership. I aspire to someday, maybe in the far future, become a strong technical leader. One of my best qualities is my (nearly) unwavering personal vendetta against mediocrity. I'm generally friendly and easy to get along with, but do not hesitate to volunteer constructive criticism where I see room for improvement. This has caused friction for me in the past, but I'm now generally good at gently steering my teammates in the direction of technical excellence.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in a lot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.” Full job listing and specific skills we are looking for: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16m4AOi_6vM8PlRFbS4CBbbph...

hn_45463144,Hardware / Embedded,"Absinthe Labs | Full-Stack Engineer | REMOTE / NYC Hybrid | Full-Time About us:
Absinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast. The problem we’re solving:
Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports. Why it matters:
This infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming the default developer layer for embedded finance. The role:
We’re hiring a Full-Stack Engineer to own features end-to-end schema design, wiring GraphQL, polished frontends, and deployment. Our stack: Next.js, Hasura, dbt, MotherDuck/DuckDB, GraphQL, and in-house Web3 indexing. See open positions here: absinthe.network/careers#open-positions Get involved:

hn_45442402,DevOps & Cloud,"Actively AI| Multiple Roles | In office in NYC | Salary + Equity What Cursor has done to revolutionize coding, we are looking to do for revenue. Every large company spends 40-50 cents of every dollar they earn on sales & marketing, and it’s very inefficient because data lives in so many different systems, sales reps are stretched thin doing manual work, and products are rapidly evolving. It’s why we are building the agent and intelligence framework for enterprise scale GTM that guides every sales motion across the funnel — from SDR outreach to AE deal strategy to cross-sell and expansion. It’s an intelligence layer that sits on top of every sales tool and with external browsing that is then customized to your specific products & GTM motions. It’s a massive technical challenge:
- Intelligence at scale: modeling millions of accounts, real-time signals, and contextual history into per-account reasoning agents.
- AI Agents & Chat: designing systems across “push” (recommendations) and “pull” (interactive assistants), with extensible skills customers can train themselves.
- Data & Infrastructure: creating a new framework for real-time, per-customer agents that simplifies pipelines, scales efficiently, and cuts costs (we’ve already cut cost per account by 50% through smarter eval-driven approaches).
- Wall-to-wall product: from self-serve UI to Slack integrations, from predictive models to generative copilots — we’re building an AI operating layer for GTM. Why Join Engineering at Actively:
- Customer-driven impact: engineers directly go onsite and spend time with customers, deploying agents that reshape workflows at companies like Samsara and Justworks.
- Category creation: there’s a huge opportunity to build the pre-dominant AI company for GTM with a massive TAM
- Cutting-edge AI: opportunity to push the frontier of reasoning agents, eval-driven development, and scalable intelligence.

It brings a beautiful, simple, and addictive [1] learning experience to languages big and small, and helps users learn 2-10x more in the same amount of time [2]. The tech stack is a ClojureScript PWA on the front end, and an Elixir umbrella application on the backend. The data processing happens in Broadway pipelines, and are horizontally scalable with FLAME. All of the data is stored in Postgres, and most of the communication between the client and server happens with a custom local-second sync engine à la Linear.app. The company is bootstrapped and bespoke.

- Delivered critical project 17% faster during company layoffs using Shape Up - Established cross-team coordination that unblocked a multiyear replatforming effort - Prevented costly microservices migration by identifying vendor's misaligned incentives Technical foundation: Ruby/Rails, Elixir/Phoenix, comprehensive DevOps (AWS/Terraform/Docker), AI security expertise.

Also built, deployed and maintained their ask-a-question-get-a-true-answer AI bot to expose 20+ years of stats to natural language fan questions! * Implemented a vector DB for one of the leading AI image hallucination platforms (millions of users) to provide an image similarity service. * replatformed dozens of complex quant jobs to AWS Lambda for a startup hedge fund (~$1B AUM), vastly improving QoS and maintenance cost.  Line 1 to platform-in-prod time 3 months, including refactoring for fit.  This was mission critical cannot-fail stuff and required extensive proof of correctness. * built a ~50 node, AWS, Dockerized, Terraform-deployed distributed system to provide realtime, transformed trade data from crypto exchanges to a Kafka pipeline and data lake (fodder for an analytics platform). Met 5000msec SLA across arbitrarily many exchanges and ticker symbols.  Blue-green deployment for complete CICD safety.  Cloudwatch metrics proved SLA was met and provided general system oversight. * built a framework to collapse dozens of singleton ETL programs into one config-driven, simple C# application performing the same functionality at ~80% reduction in maintenance cost year over year.

  Email: fstanojevic.f *at* gmail dot com A famous copywriter Gary Halbert told his students if they were to compete with his hypothetical hot-dog stand, ""I'll give you every advantage you ask for -- better hot-dogs, better prices, whatever...as long as I can get only one advantage. I want a starving crowd!"" Every week I stumble upon websites of software companies who are just as good as their more famous competitors (or even better), but their marketing sucks, and that's why they never reach the hockey-stick growth phase -- they never find their starving crowd. Or they have some traction but they don't know how to reach out to more potential customers at scale or what to even say to get them interested and book demos. Needs some help with those things?

I've also worked over a year in a classified setting and I still hold a security clearance. I'm looking for a junior/entry level software engineer position. I attended Virginia Tech for three years and studied Computer Science and Math. I got the core CS curriculum completed; the part I didn't complete were the electives. I had to stop attending because I ran out of money. Due to my current financial situation, unfortunately I'll require a salary position - no equity only.

hn_45439324,Software Engineer,"Look, I am a very experienced Developer of nearly 20 years. I have worked on countless projects as both a Front End Developer and Backend (and UI designer in the past). I have worked with many startups, long-standing corporations, governments, many name brands (in which I'm sure you've even interacted with my work multiple times and wouldn't know it), and have had my own businesses in this field. I have single handily built applications seen by millions of public users and I would absolutely bet you are one of them. I began freelancing in high-school in the late 90s. I didn't learn development from a bootcamp, I was obsessed at an early age and understood the fundamentals of JavaScript well before front-end frameworks were a thing yet my experience with React, Vue, SolidJS, and many others has been the forefront of my work for the past 13 years or so (not SolidJS obviously). I know this market isn't great on both sides, and you could absolutely hire someone outside the US for cheaper (my rate is 65/hr negotiable btw), but you would definitely not get the same experience or outcome for your project. I am also available for local hybrid (Atlanta, GA), part-time, full-time, remote etc. and am I am absolutely devoted to the work that I do. My personal hobbies include upgrading and maintaining my on-premise k8s cluster (reddit post of the first iteration: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1li74m2/first_home... ) comprised of many various Single Board Computers with different archetectures to self
host my entire digital life for security and privacy, as well as teaching a small class about the fundamentals of electronics. My talent however lies strongly on the front end but my curiosity is in linux, open source, security, and so on. Location: Atlanta, GA USA

    Email: radarsat1 [@] gmail My background is in audio and haptics with a shift towards machine learning 10 years ago. I have worked as researcher or senior SWE on various topics including computer vision (medical, automated driving) and my latest achievement is leading a small text-to-speech startup as chief technical officer, which was a great experience in leadership, as well as the ins and outs of deployment and productization. I also gained skills in cloud infrastructure and API development. Unfortunately despite technical successes we didn't achieve funding, so I am on the lookout for new opportunities and open to working on similar or new topics. I love solving problems that require interesting algorithms and messy data. Lately diving into LLMs and agentic systems to understand how to mold these powerful systems into useful components of real products. So, generally I am open to ideas: all this Gen AI stuff is fascinating and I'd love to work more with it, but if I ended up working on vision or audio again I'd also be a very happy camper. Regarding relocation, I am very close to achieving EU long term residency so while I'd be happy to relocate within Europe it would make a lot of sense for me to stay in the Netherlands for 1 more year and get this done, rather than start over again in a different country. On the other hand if I am presented with an amazing opportunity maybe it would make sense, so let's discuss it!",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45447863,hacker_news

However I’m not strong at outbound prospecting. My strengths are inbound discovery, executive alignment, and durable partnerships.

    Résumé/CV: https://bitterbridge.github.io/resume/resume.pdf
    Email: On résumé or in my profile. Hi, I'm Nate. I've been beating my head against computers for about thirty years, twenty or so of that with varying degrees of professionalism. I've done pretty much everything ""software"" at one time or another. I know a little about everything and a whole lot about nothing. I've been at my current employer five years this month and I'm getting a little restless. I'd love to get into ML if there's a scientific/research slant, e.g. simulations, optimizations, etc. I'm very interested in HPC and have played a little with Slurm/Lmod/Singularity, but haven't managed to break in. I want to do work that benefits humanity, or at least a nontrivial subset thereof. My major lifelong fascinations center around artificial life, computability, computational social sciences, GOFAI, etc, but I tend to shift focus a lot and do a lot of deep dives into random spots on the CS/IT landscape. My weaknesses: in-depth knowledge; I'm really not an SME of anything. I haven't scaled things to millions of requests per minute. I don't spend time grinding LeetCode. I'm probably not suited for early-stage startups, either temperamentally or professionally; I lean toward sustainability, pragmatism, and care, eating my own dogfood, and sticking around long enough to learn from my own mistakes. I tend to write too much. My strengths: I'm curious, easy to get along with, focused on continual improvement, and probably some kind of workaholic. I'm a good researcher and I've developed some good instincts.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45440085,hacker_news

  Email: nugraha [dot] nandiwardhana [at] protonmail [dot] com Hi there HN folks. I'm Dhani, and I've been in the tech space for the past 14 years or so (aka since I graduated). I started off building VB.NET automations around Excel and SQL server as well helping revive a left-for-dead DWH project for a bank, before venturing into telco (where I built reporting and online self-assessment platforms), consulting (implementing K2 BPA for an assortment of local companies and MNCs), e-commerce (gamification, reporting) and fintech. Fintech also happened to be the part where I took a somewhat sharp turn in my career and delved into the infra/devops/SRE side of things; which exposed me to contanerization and orchestration, and eventually later towards Kubernetes. As of now, I'm in a probationary status in a local fintech/crypto exchange, juggling between helping engineers and being a devops ticket monkey -- setting up Jenkins pipelines, GCP resources, the works. I enjoy doing R&D stuff as well as writing automations -- in a previous job posting, my probationary project was to migrate entire deployments from Flux CD into Spinnaker, which included figuring out how to integrate HC Vault without exposing secrets in the pipeline itself. If you look at my LinkedIn, I have details on the cool stuff I've worked on. I'm open to infra/SRE/devops as well as backend roles, regardless of seniority -- I've led a team for ~3 years but has since decided that being an IC allowed me more technical work, tinkering around with stuff and writing documentations (which I enjoy more). Being a tinkerer and loving to venture into the unknown, I have no qualms about learning new frameworks, technologies, or whatever esoteric stuff you need me to get up to speed to.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45447560,hacker_news

I love the web, technology, and video games. I also serve as the creator and core maintainer for Skeleton ( https://www.skeleton.dev/ ), an open source design system and component library currently available for Svelte and React (with Vue and Solid.js coming soon). I've grown the project from a small internal toolkit for a 5 person startup to a fully featured standalone library. We average around 80k downloads a month, have nearly 6k stars on GitHub, and community of over 2k members on Discord. I recently traveled to Barcelona Spain for the Svelte Summit where I had the privilege to meet many of my peers in the Svelte and greater open source community - including Rich Harris (creator of Svelte), who praised our work on Skeleton. I would love to work on FOSS all day every day, but in order to support myself I split my time and operate as a freelancer alongside my open source contributions. This means I'm currently available around 20-30 hours a week Monday-Friday. I'm open to any sort of interesting project with a focus on frontend web. I'm also available to act in a consultant role.

  Email: See CV I just graduated from a Master's in AI, with some bio and neuroscience sprinkled in. I've been programming since I was 14 (11 years ago now - wow) and well yeah I love it. I love making things that people use! I'm now looking for a job, but honestly, for my 40-hours-a-week, I want to work on something impactful. Climate tech! Medicine! Energy! Maybe AI? Big data...? I don't know, I think pure tech/software companies can also be great, but reading the posts on the 'Who is hiring' threads doesn't exactly fill me with excitement. But sometimes pure tech really scratches that itch, you know? Startup culture sounds super fun! Or I spend too much time on hn, idk. I'd love to make use of my relatively generalist skills, and just try to make something that people use. Ideally, even improve their lives. I'm probably being way too optimistic on what I can realistically find, especially at this stage of my career, but hey you gotta start somewhere. If anyone's reading this - hi! Thank you for reading whatever this is, I think I roughly just want to give an idea of my uhhh... vibe. Final (serious) note, because at the end of the day I am looking for a job: I try to write clean, performant code, using the right technologies for the job. I care about creating well-designed, intuitive programs. And I care about getting things done! If that's a piece of software, or using software to achieve something else, I'm happy to do it.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45441982,hacker_news

I’m Aishwarya, a recent MS Information Science graduate from the University of Pittsburgh (May 2025, GPA 3.83). My background blends AI/ML, automation, and full-stack development, and I’m passionate about building systems that actually ship and solve real problems. I’ve worked at Allianz Partners and Utopia Global, building UiPath + AI automations that cut hundreds of hours of manual effort (SAP, HR screening, invoice processing, finance workflows). One global bot I built was demoed to the CEO/COO and adopted across multiple teams. At C1, I interned as an AI Developer, focusing on conversational AI and LLM-driven flows, shipping features into customer-facing systems. I also published a research paper on AI + RPA invoice processing (2022). Some projects I’m proud of: - AI Job Assistant — A full web app (React + FastAPI + MongoDB) that parses resumes, scores them against JDs, generates tailored answers, and tracks applications. - Live Transcriber (Chrome Extension) — Real-time audio-to-text transcription tool using LLMs for accessibility and productivity. - UiPath Automations — End-to-end bots for SAP, BlackLine, HR screening, and invoice processing pipelines. - TasteTrails Blog — Interactive food + travel platform (reviews, itineraries, maps, user accounts, CRUD ops). - Distributed Computing Environment — Hadoop + Docker setup for fault-tolerant parallel processing. - Blockchain-Assisted Cassandra — A secure, verifiable database system combining Cassandra with blockchain proofs. I’ve also led communities — as VP of the Graduate Student Organization at Pitt and as a Global Graduate Mentor — where I learned how to explain complex concepts simply, support others, and grow teams. I’m looking for full-time roles in AI/ML engineering, software engineering, data engineering, or automation, ideally where I can work end-to-end, from prototyping to production, while making an impact on real users.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45511252,hacker_news

Email: TaylorBlocker@gmail.com I’m a resourceful and reliable technology professional with over eight years of experience spanning applications development, IT operations, software engineering, and enterprise system support. I am a career technologist who believes that technology should deliver optimal experiences for end users while championing strategic goals for business. Whether I’m building clean, maintainable code, designing high-quality web applications, or troubleshooting system vulnerabilities, my focus is always on creating solutions that are scalable, efficient, and user-friendly. I’ve built my career on a balance of technical depth and human connection. On the technical side, I thrive in environments where I can dive into code, analyze complex systems, and optimize processes. I’ve succeeded in:
- Reducing application latency from 30 seconds to under one second.
- Maintaining more than 100 RESTful API endpoints.
- Writing or updating over 500,000 lines of code that power everything from web applications to mobile platforms. I’ve worked across industries and projects where adaptability and continuous learning were key. I’ve built expertise across cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and frameworks (React, Node.js, Laravel, .NET, CodeIgniter, Express). I’m fluent in multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and Typescript, and I’m comfortable navigating version control tools like Git and SourceTree. What excites me most is the challenge of problem-solving and the chance to deliver solutions that make a real difference for users and businesses alike. I’m always experimenting with new programming techniques, sharpening my knowledge in full-stack development, and exploring ways to visualize data and optimize performance. For me, staying relevant in this industry means not only keeping up with the pace of change but staying curious enough to anticipate what’s next. Colleagues have seen me as a collaborator and leader who’s approachable and friendly, yet willing to step up and guide a team with clarity and purpose. I take pride in fostering environments where people feel supported, where feedback flows openly, and where projects stay aligned to both technical best practices and organizational goals. If you’re looking for someone who can bridge the gap between deep technical expertise and effective collaboration, while driving innovation and performance, I’d love to connect.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45464696,hacker_news
hn_45453103,Hardware / Embedded,"Location: Canada <-> Central America <-> Mexico Remote only : 10 years remote, 12 years experience Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, WebGL, WASM, JS, TS Interests : systems programming, 2D & 3D graphics, performance -------- Hello, my name is Jesse. I describe myself as a competent generalist, and a lifelong learner. I'm frequently working on something I've never done before.  My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup; I wrote prototypes for an ISA, compiler and a (really sweet) cycle simulator & debugger. In terms of hard technical skills, I can quickly become productive in nearly any language, and at any level of the stack.  I'm comfortable working in soft-realtime environments which are heavily multithreaded/async, and performance is a key acceptance criteria.   I have a good understanding of modern hardware architectures, including GPUs, from main memory to registers and instruction pipelines.  I have working knowledge of interpreters and dynamic language runtimes, including GCs.  I'm convinced I can learn nearly anything (albeit some things more quickly than others), given an appropriate problem domain to apply it to. In terms of business value, I can take hand-wavy visions of new products and turn them into working prototype(s), quickly.  I'm comfortable refining those raw materials and delivering real value to customers, internal or external.  I have a long track record of successfully identifying 80/20 solutions and love the feeling of making tools that make peoples lives better. I'm a natural leader; informal teams coalesce around me when I'm not in a labelled position of leadership.  I aspire to someday, maybe in the far future, become a strong technical leader.  One of my best qualities is my (nearly) unwavering personal vendetta against mediocrity.  I'm generally friendly and easy to get along with, but do not hesitate to volunteer constructive criticism where I see room for improvement.  This has caused friction for me in the past, but I'm now generally good at gently steering my teammates in the direction of technical excellence. In my personal life, I enjoy travelling, surfing, climbing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, pirates, and attending raves.  I like the phrase ""have strong opinions, weakly held"". If I was born to do one thing in this world, it's program computers.

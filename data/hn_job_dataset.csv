I do some consulting to bootstrap the company with and build customer relations. Simultaenously, we're starting to build a product business. For that we have strengthened the team with a Senior ML Engineer (ex google) and a Head of Data with prior experience in setting up data pipelines in this domain.

Role: So given that it is pretty early days, we're of course looking for a broader skillset to lead the development especially of the cloud and backend infrastructure (hetzner), but eventually also frontend applications. Techstack so far is obviously minimal (linux, python, bash, postgres/timescale), so there is plenty of room to also shape this. What we as a team value is simplicity, really clean code/architectures, excellent documentations and quality over speed.

We're live in thousands of classrooms for in-class assignments, extra practice, and homework. Students work on a whiteboard while our models analyze their work in real time and nudge them with questions that make them think. Teachers get instant visibility into how the class is doing, who needs help, and what to assign next. We just raised our seed round and are backed by the Gates Foundation, giving us the ability to build something transformative in education. Here's what you might work on: - Create shareable ""aha moment"" videos from real student sessions. Turn anonymized whiteboard work and Goblin–student dialogues into short videos or interactive replays that highlight the value of Goblins. Automatically identify the best moments, strip out sensitive data, and produce artifacts that teachers, parents, and districts want to watch and share. - Rewrite our diffusion transformer real-time avatar stack. Our Goblin avatars are already in production. Improve audio–motion sync, temporal coherence, and expressiveness, while cutting latency and cost so they run smoothly at 100k+ student scale. - Extend continuous diagnostics to high-stakes like the SAT and ACT. We track mastery against state standards with our spin on IRT. Extend this to SAT/ACT-style exams: infer score distributions from behavior, validate on real data, and compute minimal targeted practice that reliably moves predicted scores. - Design uncheatable problem formats. Generative AI can solve most traditional math problems and show fake work. Build formats where copying is harder than thinking: dynamic graphs, constructive proofs, counterexample generation, debugging flawed solutions, multi-step conceptual checks. Make them auto-gradable, resistant to copy-paste, and stable at scale. - Build real-time instructional agents. Detect underlying student misconceptions from their work and have an agent ""drop in"" only when needed. It should generate short, visual, 3blue1brown-style explanations tailored to the specific misunderstanding, and create diagrams, animations, and interactive examples that adapt as the student responds. The role is based in our Williamsburg, Brooklyn office in NYC (on-site only). You'll join our tight-knit founding engineering team of 3—myself (the CTO) and two founding engineers with collective experience from Stanford, Stripe, Amazon, and X1.

Places and Queries against those places are listed in sequential order in a commands.txt file in a colon-seperated format. A query is a circle with a center point and radius, along with a collection of 0-N expected places contained within it. Place - id, x, y
    Query - id, x, y, radius, expected return values (comma-separated) The task is to persist the places data in sequence and ensure queries return the set of expected places out of all places that have been seen so far. This is a basic geometry problem - if the euclidian distance (x^2 + y^2 = r^2) between any place and the circle's center is less than the radius, the place is contained in the circle.

The problem we’re solving: Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions.

    - Raise the engineering bar: define and enforce code review policy, branching model, testing strategy, and CI/CD gates.
    
    - Partner with Product & domain experts: translate healthcare workflows into configurable front-end modules; ensure back-end transforms to valid FHIR in Medplum. What makes you a great fit: - 8+ years building production systems, including principal/staff scope in a startup or similar pace.

    - Deep TypeScript + Node.js and expert-level NestJS in production.

    - Track record leading cross-team projects and influencing architecture without heavy process.

We have a proven, ""sticky"" training program that solves the single biggest problem in organizations today: The Relationship Gap. We’re not selling abstract theory. We sell a practical, example-driven blueprint for leadership (using our proprietary ""Be Like Tony & Don't Be Like Chad"" framework) that helps organizations in public service, manufacturing, and healthcare solve their $223 billion crisis of cultural disconnection. We have the product. We're looking for partners who have the relationships. The Opportunity: Two Ways to Earn
We are recruiting a small team of commission-based partners to bring this vital training to their networks. 1. The Certified Partner (White-Label):
This is for independent consultants, coaches, and trainers. We will white-label our entire online course with your brand, logo, and welcome video. It becomes your product. You sell it to your clients and keep a significant portion of the revenue. Stop trading your time for money and add a scalable, recurring income stream to your practice. 2. The Affiliate Partner (Referral-Based):
This is for retired executives and well-connected professionals. You make high-level introductions to your network (City Managers, Police/Fire Chiefs, Plant Managers, HR VPs). When we close a deal for in-person or online training, you earn a generous referral commission. You leverage your credibility; we do the rest. Who We Are Looking For:
• Profile 1: The Independent Consultant. You are an HR, OD, or leadership consultant, etc., looking for a proven, high-quality curriculum to sell to your existing clients.
• Profile 2: The ""Encore Career"" Executive. You are a retired/semi-retired leader (e.g., City Manager, Police/Fire Chief, HR Director, Operations VP, etc.) who wants to leverage your network for a flexible, lucrative, and meaningful opportunity. This is a 100% commission-based partnership for established professionals who understand that their relationships are their most valuable asset. If you are a high-level connector ready to monetize your network by solving a real-world problem, we want to talk to you.

45451010,DevOps & Cloud,"Erdos Miller | Data Wrangler (Part-time → Full-time growth) | Remote (US preferred, flexible otherwise) We build Measurement While Drilling (MWD) equipment — and we love it. That passion helped us capture the majority of the North American oil & gas market, and now it’s fueling our geothermal innovation, building underground navigation systems for the next generation of clean energy. We’re now looking for a Data Wrangler to help us make smarter, faster decisions with our data. This role blends data engineering and data science: wrangling quirky file formats, structuring messy datasets, and turning it all into live tools that guide company strategy. Starts part-time with the opportunity to grow into a full-time, career-defining role.
What you’ll do Partner with the CEO + stakeholders to translate business needs into pipelines, dashboards, and tools.
Build ETL pipelines, write parsers for proprietary formats, and maintain relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Create interactive dashboards/apps with Dash, Streamlit, or similar (we avoid Tableau/Excel hell).
Deliver insights via live web apps where data isn’t static — it’s explorable.
Tech we use
Python, SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL), S3, modal.com.
Bonus: React/web dev experience to shape customer-facing real-time tools.
Why you’ll like it here
You’ll own projects end-to-end, avoid over-engineering (no Kubernetes, no Airflow — just the right tools), and directly influence decisions. As our company and data needs grow, so does your role.
If this sounds fun, email ken@erdosmiller.com with your background and what excites you about wrangling data.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45451010

We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

45443278,DevOps & Cloud,"Third Iron | Senior Full-Stack Software Developer | REMOTE (US) Do you want to develop software that helps scientists, doctors, and historians discover breakthroughs? Join our small, fully-distributed software development team to help connect scholars of all disciplines with peer-reviewed journal articles. Our company has been remote-first since we began in 2011. You’ll join a team with plenty of experience putting into practice what works well remotely, and avoiding what doesn’t.
Third Iron has never taken VC money, and we’ve never had layoffs. Our approach to hiring and selling our products helps us feel confident that this pattern will continue far into the future. Third Iron software is used by researchers at over 1,500 libraries, including universities, hospitals, corporations, and government agencies located in over 35 countries. In a refreshing change from advertising-dependent tech companies and those who sell user data, we instead have a business-to-business model. We sell our subscription-based services to libraries, and anyone affiliated with one of these libraries can use our software. We do not sell user data. Our focus is on building the best software to enable research that changes the world. We’re looking for a developer interested in full-stack work, since we have a variety of upcoming initiatives, some being mostly front-end, some being mostly back-end, and some a balance of the two. The front-end of our stack primarily consists of JavaScript, using EmberJS for two major projects, and React for two others. Our backend is written in NodeJS, and features data storage using PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and CouchDB, and hosting primarily on AWS and HEroku. If you’re interested in this fully remote position, we're interested to chat with you!

Absinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast. The problem we’re solving:
Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports. Why it matters:
This infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming the default developer layer for embedded finance. The role:

The tech stack is a ClojureScript PWA on the front end, and an Elixir umbrella application on the backend. The data processing happens in Broadway pipelines, and are horizontally scalable with FLAME. All of the data is stored in Postgres, and most of the communication between the client and server happens with a custom local-second sync engine à la Linear.app. The company is bootstrapped and bespoke. There’s no investors, there’s no AI generated code, no shadcdn UIs. I miss the days of the early internet, and acutely feel the mass enshittification of the web. I’m really trying to do something different with the experience as well as the business, all in hopes to bring back a little bit of that wonder that was so prevalent in the days of the early internet. The app is all working, the experience is great, and the onboarding was just finished. I’ve been using the app now to successfully learn 18 languages [3] and it’s truly a joy to use. Just finishing up the new site [4] after feedback from our last launch and getting ready for more launches [5].

45443388,ML & Data Science,"Zoca | AI Engineer | Full-time | Bangalore (In-office) I'm Shambhav, CTO & co-founder at Zoca. I'm building a team to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. So far, we've built a platform from Bangalore that has outperformed every competitor in our space — small businesses happily pay us 10x our competitors' price because our agents actually work. These agents work like real business partners, generate leads, do followups, book appointments, manage reviews and more. We're already powering growth for over a thousand businesses. In the next 12 months, we're going to scale this to tens of thousands, while making the agents smarter, more reliable, and capable of things people think aren't possible today. We'll be working on technical challenges like multi-channel conversations, browser automation at scale, retrieval pipelines, and real-time monitoring/eval loops. I need AI Engineers who want to build like founders — not paper over things in a research repo, but ship production systems that touch real users. Strong TS/Python skills, a builder's mindset, and a track record of actually building (agents, GSoC projects, or similar) is what I'm looking for. If this excites you, send me an email at shambhav@zoca.com with your working demos or GitHub profile. Show me what you've hacked on.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45443388

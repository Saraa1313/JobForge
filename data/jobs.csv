It was designed to be language agnostic, and currently fully supports over 80 languages. It brings a beautiful, simple, and addictive [1] learning experience to languages big and small, and helps users learn 2-10x more in the same amount of time [2]. The tech stack is a ClojureScript PWA on the front end, and an Elixir umbrella application on the backend. The data processing happens in Broadway pipelines, and are horizontally scalable with FLAME. All of the data is stored in Postgres, and most of the communication between the client and server happens with a custom local-second sync engine à la Linear.app. The company is bootstrapped and bespoke. There’s no investors, there’s no AI generated code, no shadcdn UIs. I miss the days of the early internet, and acutely feel the mass enshittification of the web. I’m really trying to do something different with the experience as well as the business, all in hopes to bring back a little bit of that wonder that was so prevalent in the days of the early internet.

Just finishing up the new site [4] after feedback from our last launch and getting ready for more launches [5].

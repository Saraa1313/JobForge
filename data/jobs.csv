The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children. We're looking for full stack software engineers - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no ""front end team"" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can! You'll need to visit our London office roughly once a month. Email alistair.clark@devyce.co.uk and mention that you saw this on Ask HN: Who is hiring?"

WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots.

We’re looking for senior software engineers to build our data platform and help us ingest and model messy, unstructured data into insights and actionable intelligence. At the heart of this is a 50m+ entity knowledge-graph with 200m+ relationships represented - and we need your help to build a system that can scale this up by an order of a magnitude. Today, we mostly use Python, Postgres, Airflow and Pyspark. If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you. Apply here: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/wirescreen/89e08ab3-01ed-4296-9459-...

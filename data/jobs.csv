All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world's best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career. We've raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools. The first step was creating a high-quality editor to serve as the user interface. Now this new investment lets us expand to tackle the next phase of our plan. We're developing a new kind of operation-based version control that incrementally tracks the evolution of your code with edit-level granularity, and we're integrating it into Zed to make collaboration, both with agents and teammates, a first-class part of the coding experience.

Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast. The problem we’re solving: Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today. We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports. Why it matters: This infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming the default developer layer for embedded finance.

WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots. That’s where we come in—surfacing the networks, relationships, and financial ties behind companies to support national security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. We’re hiring on the backend to help solve one of the hardest problems in data engineering: building a production knowledge graph from millions of fragmented, inconsistent Chinese corporate records where traditional approaches break down. Our PySpark/EMR/Airflow pipeline is just the foundation.  The real challenges are in entity resolution across transliterated names and obfuscated ownership structures, bipartite matching algorithms and inferring relationships. We build our product on top of that with a Django/FastAPI/React stack to help our users access that knowledge graph to analyze and investigate any risks they should be aware of. If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you.
